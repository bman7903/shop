incomplete shopping cart.  Utalized mandrill api (when it was free) to verify user creation via automatic email.  Users could add items to sell, fill out description, provide url for a picture, and that item would appear in random order on the landing.  Mongolab db backend, also free.  Made for appengine.

User account is suspended with the mandrill api but you can login as usr: mrsx passwd: GofuckyourselF  to add items and see them updated on the landing.  A imgur upload example is in pad.git but you can also use imaged from anywher online.
